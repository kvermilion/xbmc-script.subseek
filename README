SubSeek is an innovative seeking interface for xbmc. It allows the user to search subtitle information for a specific part of a video, and then seek to it.

Usage
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
When watching a video, call your skin's OSD, and call the subtitle script. If you do not have a compatible subtitle selected, the XBMC Subtitles script will be called, and you must select a subtitle to use, (Make sure to select a .srt file) and then call the script again. Click the "Enter Search Terms" button, and enter a phrase or word from the video. A list of matches will be shown. Click the correct one.
